In order for these to function you need to create a folder anywhere you want then add to PATH for example below we will be using ~/bin which ever changes you decide to make you are on your own.

Also we will be using zsh / ohmyzsh. inside the .zshrc with your favourite editor
sudo vim .zshrc

locate: export PATH=/home/$USER/bin:

esc, :, wq, enter
